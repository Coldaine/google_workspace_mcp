📋 **Consolidation Plan - Strategic Recommendations**

After reviewing CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md, here's a suggested prioritization for Phase 2:

**Priority 1: Google Docs (14 → 7 tools, -7 tools)**
- Largest impact on tool count
- Complex operations that would benefit from consolidation
- Suggested grouping:
  - manage_document: create, get, copy
  - edit_document_content: insert_text, replace_text, delete_text
  - manage_document_structure: headers, footers, sections
  - manage_tables: CRUD operations
  - Keep separate: batch_update, get_selection_content (special operations)

**Priority 2: Google Drive (6 → 4 tools, -2 tools)**
- Simpler consolidation
- Good for validating patterns from Docs work
- Suggested grouping:
  - manage_drive_file: create, get, update, delete, list
  - manage_drive_permissions: share, list_permissions
  - drive_operations: move, copy, download, upload

**Priority 3: Google Sheets (6 → 4 tools, -2 tools)**
- Similar to Drive in complexity
- Suggested grouping:
  - manage_sheet_data: read, write, append, batch
  - manage_sheet_structure: formatting, protection

This will accelerate future consolidations!
